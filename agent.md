## Git & Efficiency Standards
- **Commit Format:** Use Conventional Commits (e.g., `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`).
- **Atomic Commits:** Make a separate commit for each logical change rather than one giant update.
- **Efficiency:** - Output ONLY the necessary code changes unless an explanation is requested.
    - Prioritize `ThreadPoolExecutor` for network tasks to maximize performance.
    - Always check if a `requirements.txt` needs updating when adding new imports.
- **Directory Access:** You have full permission to read and write to any file in the current directory tree.
